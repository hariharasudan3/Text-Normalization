This tool simplifies text preprocessing using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It helps standardize and break down text for easier analysis.

## Features

- **Text Normalization:** Convert text to lowercase and remove punctuation for consistency.
- **Remove Stopwords:** Filter out common words (e.g., "and", "the", "is") to focus on meaningful content.
- **Tokenize into Words:** Split text into individual words for detailed analysis.
- **Tokenize into Sentences:** Divide text into sentences to understand its structure.
- **Tokenize into Paragraphs:** Separate text into paragraphs for deeper document analysis.

## Usage
1. **Text Normalization:** Converts text to lowercase and removes punctuation marks.
2. **Remove Stopwords:** Filters out common words to highlight significant content.
3. **Tokenize into Words**
     - **Input:** "Tokenization is an important step."
     - **Output:** ["Tokenization", "is", "an", "important", "step", "."]
4. **Tokenize into Sentences**
     - **Input:** "Tokenization is important. It breaks down text."
     - **Output:** ["Tokenization is important.", "It breaks down text."]
5. **Tokenize into Paragraphs**
     - **Input:** "Tokenization is important. It involves breaking down text into units.\n\nAfter tokenization, further analysis is possible."
     - **Output:** ["Tokenization is important. It involves breaking down text into units.", "After tokenization, further analysis is possible."]
